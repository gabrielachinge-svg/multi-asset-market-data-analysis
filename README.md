# Multi-Asset Market Data Analysis (Python | Jupyter)

## Overview
This project analyzes historical price and volume data across equities, FX, and crypto markets using Python.  
The objective is to extract statistical insights from OHLCV data through exploratory data analysis, time-series metrics, and regime identification.

## Objectives
- Analyze multi-asset market data using Python
- Clean and standardize OHLCV datasets for cross-asset comparison
- Measure returns, volatility, and correlations
- Identify market regimes and trend persistence
- Visualize insights for analytical interpretation

## Data
Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data sourced from publicly available market datasets.
Assets analyzed include:
- Equities
- Foreign Exchange (FX)
- Cryptocurrencies

## Key Analysis
- Log returns and percentage returns
- Rolling volatility and risk dynamics
- Cross-asset correlation matrices
- Volatility-based regime identification
- Trend persistence using rolling statistics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – step-by-step analysis notebooks
- `data/` – sample datasets
- `src/` – reusable utility functions
- `README.md` – project documentation

## Results & Insights
The analysis highlights differences in volatility behavior, correlation patterns, and regime shifts across asset classes.  
Findings demonstrate how market behavior changes across time and conditions, reinforcing the importance of regime-aware analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Financial data handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series analysis
- Statistical reasoning
- Market intuition

## Future Improvements
- Extend analysis to additional assets
- Incorporate risk metrics (VaR, drawdown)
- Apply feature engineering for trading analysis
